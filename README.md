# cfs-project
Sample project

- The backend API must be running on localhost:8081, this is required as the frontend will request the API on that port

## Starting the project
- After you change directories into the respective project and run the `npm install` command you will be able to start them both
- The frontend project can be started by executing the `npm run start` command in the `cfs-project-ui` directory.
- The backend API can be started by running `node app.js` in the `cfs-project-backend` directory.
